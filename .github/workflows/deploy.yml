      # If your project is in the root of the repo, the path is:
      # run: dotnet publish BlazorWebAssemblyApp.csproj -c Release -o app/publish --nologo
      # --nologo is only cosmetic. More important is the configuration of the project file if you want to set the base path during build instead of in index.html.
      
    # When users access the application directly after deployment (https://chstorb.github.io/) it works, but with a deep link
    # or after a refresh on a subpage (e.g. /radzengrid) they get a 404 Not Found error. GitHub Pages is a static
    # host and does not know how to handle Blazor routing. The solution is to copy index.html to 404.html.
    # GitHub Pages uses 404.html as a fallback for not found routes, allowing Blazor to take over routing.
